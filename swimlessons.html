          <p>Private Swim Lessons</p>
          <p>
            Our private swim lessons provide one-on-one instruction for students
            ages three months through adult. Private swim lessons are the best
            option for accelerated learning. Each lesson will allow our
            instructors to build on the momentum and skills taught in the
            previous lesson with minimal downtime. From the basics of putting
            your face into the water to refining your stroke technique, private
            lessons will offer the highest rate of progress.

          <p>Semi-Private Swim Lessons</p>
          <p>
            At Splashes, our semi-private swim lessons offer students ages 2.5
            to 13 the opportunity to interact with another student of a similar
            age and ability while still receiving personal attention. Whether
            you would like us to pair your child with another student of similar
            age and ability or would like to take lessons with a friend or
            sibling, our semi-private lessons are a cost effective option.
            Students also have the opportunity to observe one another in the
            lesson.

          <p>Parent & Me Lessons</p>
          <p>
            Our Parent and Me swimming lessons (also known as “Mommy and Me” or
            “Daddy and Me” classes) gives parents the opportunity to be hands-on
            with their little one while our instructors facilitate the learning
            process between you and your child. These lessons provide a fun and
            relaxed environment for you and your child in the water. Children
            ages 3 months through 3 years of age can participate. However, we
            encourage children ages 2.5 and older to participate in private or
            semi-private swim lessons.

          <p>Stroke Clinic</p>
          <p>
            Splashes Stroke Clinics give students the opportunity to advance
            their swimming techniques while in a group setting. Our Stroke
            Clinic classes place emphasis on proper technique over speed and
            prepare students for swim team. Swimmers ages 5 and older who are
            level 8 or higher can benefit from participating in these 40 minute
            classes. A strong technical foundation will ensure that students’
            progress much faster when the time comes for them to work on speed.
            Our stroke clinics are exciting and fast paced, where each student
            will receive a great workout.
