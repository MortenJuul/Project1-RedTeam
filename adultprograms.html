        <h1>Get Fit & Stay Fit With Daily Lap Swimming</h1>
        <p>
          Adult lap swimming provides a full-body workout that targets the core,
          arms, back, and legs. It also provides swimmers with access to various
          training methods including strength training, aerobic training, and
          low-impact training.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are looking to improve your workout routine, be sure to stop by
          a Splashes Aquatics location to learn more about adult lap swimming.
          Swimmers will find that there are times throughout the week that will
          work with your schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each lane will have up to two lap swimmers. Children under the age of
          14 must be accompanied by their parent and able to swim 200 yards of
          the pool on their own. Lanes are limited during shared pool usage. No
          private swim instruction or coaching is permitted. No Lifeguard on
          duty. **NOTE: If you would like to reserve the entire lane for
          yourself, and not have to share with another swimmer, you may reserve
          both A and B slots for your selected lane/time.**
